# Ubiquiti test assignment
Thank you for letting me make such an amazing test assignment. It was very challenging and interesting at the same time.
Here's the list of thinks I've done and I haven't done. I've deployed my result in netlify (https://splendorous-tapioca-fdbc40.netlify.app/)
and also created a git repository https://github.com/energizer91/ubiquiti-test-assignment

## What i've done:
- Based on Create React App
- Reading UIDB
- Rendering Table and Grid
- Device info view
- Filtering (together with reset)
- Tab navigation with proper focus states
- Handling of large data (using `react-window` as an external library)
- Automatic specs retrieval (You didn't provide exact specs I should grab, so I tried to do it as I understood)
- Deploying website to https://splendorous-tapioca-fdbc40.netlify.app/
- JSON viewer (minimalistic design since it wasn't provided)
- Error and loading handling

## What I haven't done:
- Mobile and Tablet versions (again, because no design and partially lack of time)
- a bunch of small tweaks (margins in checkbox outlines for example)
- Image skeletons (wasn't a part of design but saw it on your websites and thought it's cool)
